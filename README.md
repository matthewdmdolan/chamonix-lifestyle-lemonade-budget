# chamonix-lifestyle-lemonade-budget

The inspiration for this application comes from my own experiences of being a skint student spending hours switching skyscanner criteria, to find the cheapest flights for a given month. 
Therefore, I wanted a mechanism to demonstrate just how cheap travel can be if flexible. 

The problem with current flight search engines is that they're often too obtuse in their searches, to provide a quick overview of prices. 

Therefore, I wanted to narrow the parameters of finding the cheapest flights from a region of the UK to provide a more concise overview.
